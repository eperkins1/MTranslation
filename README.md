# MTranslation

My code contribution to the machine translation final project for CS 124: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

This code is missing essential files necessary to run, which are stored privately. The files here provide examples for language models in use (unigram and bigram), 
a parsing file and a file to connect to the Python NLP library nltk (Natural Language Toolkit). The translator translates Spanish text to English text.
